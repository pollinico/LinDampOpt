# Gradient-based optimization of added fluid viscous dampers for seismic retrofitting in Python
Gradient-based optimization of added fluid viscous dampers for the sesmic retrofitting of a 2D sheear frame with two degrees of freedom.   
Both the dampers and the structure have a linear behavior.  
The structural response is caclulated with a linear time-history analysis.  
The maximum peak drift in time is constrained to a maximum allowed value (0.009 m). 
The structure is subjected to a reaslitic ground acceleration record.  
The gradient is calculated with an adjoint method.  
For details on the adjoint sensitivity analysis see:
