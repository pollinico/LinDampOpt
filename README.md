# Gradient-based transient optimization of added fluid viscous dampers for seismic retrofitting in Python    

Gradient-based optimization of added fluid viscous dampers for the seismic retrofitting of a 2D shear frame with two degrees of freedom.     
Both the dampers and the structure have a linear behavior.

The structural response is calculated with a linear time-history analysis.   
The maximum peak drift in time is constrained to a maximum allowed value (9 mm).  
The structure is subjected to a realistic ground acceleration record (El Centro).

The gradient is calculated with an adjoint method.
